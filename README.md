# Engine
A lightweight 2D/3D engine for Nim. Uses SDL and Opengl.
Currently engine focuses on 2D stuff and it aims to cover my specific needs as I am game developer by trade and make 2d games. The engine is not feature complete and currently the best it can do is to render lots of sprites and texts pretty effectively.

In order to run examples on Windows you will need to copy SDL dlls and assets folder from examples to where your compiled executables are saved. The Dlls itself can be found in libs folder or downloaded elsewhere including SDL official site.

New features, documentation will be provided at some point in the future.

* __Why Nim?__ 
    
    It's a fun language to work with and I believe it's the best language out there to make games. I'm biased though :)
